imp: use python 3.6 or above 

Python interpretation of the logic gates

- AND
- OR
- NOT
- NOR
- XOR
- NAND

### Any gate can be realized using NAND gate only

• Not ( x ) = x Nand x                                                        Not can be realized using Nand
• x And y = Not ( x Nand y)                                                   And can be realized using Nand
• x Or y = Not(Not(x) And Not(y))                                             Or can be realized using Nand
